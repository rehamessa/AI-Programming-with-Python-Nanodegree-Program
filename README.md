# AI-Programming-with-Python-Nanodegree-Program
### Lesson Plan
Udacity offers the AI Programming with Python Nanodegree to a wide range of students. As such, our students come from various backgrounds. Some of you will have had previous coding experience and some will have had none. For this reason we offer two suggested lesson plans. One lesson plan will apply to those of you with previous coding experience. The other will apply to those of you who feel they need more time to build coding confidence.
